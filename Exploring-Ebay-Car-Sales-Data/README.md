# Exploring-Ebay-Car-Sales-Data

In this project, I worked with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a [classifieds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classified_advertising) section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally [scraped](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) and uploaded to [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data). A few modifications were made by [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/) to the original dataset that was uploaded to Kaggle:

- The dataset was trimmed down to 50,000 data points from the full dataset
- The dataset was dirtied a bit to more closely resemble what could be expected from a scraped dataset (the version uploaded to Kaggle was cleaned to be easier to work with)

This was done to allow data scientists to put into use their data cleaning skills.

The aim of this project was to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.
