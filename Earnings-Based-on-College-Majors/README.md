# Job Outcomes of College Students Between 2010 and 2012 in the U.S.

In this project, I worked with a dataset on the job outcomes of students who graduated from college between 2010 and 2012. The original data on job outcomes was released by [American Community Survey](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/), which conducts surveys and aggregates the data. [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/) cleaned the dataset and released it on their [Github repo](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/college-majors).

This project was done to showcase how using the pandas plotting functionality along with the Jupyter notebook interface allows us to explore data quickly using visualizations.

Using visualizations, I explored the following questions from the dataset:

- Do students in more popular majors make more money?
- How many majors are predominantly male? Predominantly female?
- Which category of majors have the most students?
