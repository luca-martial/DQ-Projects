# Analyzing Employee Exit Surveys

In this project, I worked with exit surveys from employees of the [Department of Education, Training and Employment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Department_of_Education_and_Training_(Queensland)) (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia.

I played the role of a data analyst and pretended my stakeholders want to know the following:

- Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?
- Did more employees in the DETE or TAFE institute end their employment because they were dissatisfied in some way?
- How many people in each age group resgined due to some kind of dissatisfaction? Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?

I had to combine the results for *both* surveys to answer these questions. However, although both used the same survey template, one of them customized some of the answers. I therefore aimed to perform lots of data cleaning before getting started analyzing.
