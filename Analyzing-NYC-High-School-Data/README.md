# Analyzing NYC High School Data

New York City has published the following data on student [SAT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAT) scores by high school, along with additional demographic data sets:

- SAT scores by school - SAT scores for each high school in New York City
- School attendance - Attendance information for each school in New York City
- Class size - Information on class size for each school
- AP test results - Advanced Placement (AP) exam results for each high school (passing an optional AP exam in a particular subject can earn a student college credit in that subject)
- Graduation outcomes - The percentage of students who graduated, and other outcome information
- Demographics - Demographic information for each school
- School survey - Surveys of parents, teachers, and students at each school

New York City has a significant immigrant population and is very diverse, so comparing demographic factors such as race, income and gender with SAT scores can be an interesting way to explore whether the SAT is a fair test. This was the goal of this quick analysis.
