    "# Exploring Hacker News Posts\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Hacker news is a site started by the startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), where user-submitted stories (known as 'posts') are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our [data set](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts) has been reduced from almost 300,000 rows to approximately 20,000 rows by removing all submissions that did not receive any comments, and then randomly sampling from the remaining submissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either 'Ask HN' or 'Show HN'. Users submit 'Ask HN' posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Likewise, users submit 'Show HN' posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll compare these two types of posts to determine the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Do Ask HN or Show HN posts receive more comments on average?\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?\n",
    "- Do Ask HN or Show HN posts receive more points on average?\n",
    "- Do posts created at a certain time receive more points on average?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "After analyzing the data, we reached the conclusion that Hacker News 'Ask' posts get more comments than 'Show' posts, whereas 'Show' posts get more points than 'Ask' posts. Authors looking to ask a question and get many responses are better off posting between 12p.m. and 4p.m. EST. On the other hand, Hacker News authors that are looking to share one of their creations and get many views are better off posting between 11a.m. and 2p.m. EST.\n",
