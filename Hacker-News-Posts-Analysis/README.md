# Exploring Hacker News Posts

In this project, I worked with a data set of submissions to popular technology site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

Hacker news is a site started by the startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/), where user-submitted stories (known as 'posts') are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit.

I was specifically interested in posts whose titles begin with either 'Ask HN' or 'Show HN'. Users submit 'Ask HN' posts to ask the Hacker News community a specific question. Likewise, users submit 'Show HN' posts to show the Hacker News community a project, product, or just generally something interesting.

I compared these two types of posts to determine the following:

- Do Ask HN or Show HN posts receive more comments on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more comments on average?
- Do Ask HN or Show HN posts receive more points on average?
- Do posts created at a certain time receive more points on average?
